MooEditr Localization
========================

The file MooEditr.English.US.example.js is an example locale file as reference for non US English translators. Do not use this file.

By default, MooEditr is localized to US English, without dependency on [MooTools.lang](http://mootools.net/docs/more/Core/Lang). MooTools.lang is only required when using the localization files to add additional languages.

Localization of actions should go into the Actions folder, with the same name as the action's javascript file.
